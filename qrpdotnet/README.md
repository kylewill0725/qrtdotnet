# Qwyll's Relic Tracker
#### Background
[Warframe](https://www.warframe.com) is a game developed by Digital Extremes. One of the 
games objectives is to to gather items that can be sold for either platinum, the in-game premium
currency, or ducats. Ducats are used every two weeks to trade for more powerful rare mods. A 
relic is an item that is used to play certain missions for special rare drops that are stronger 
than their default counter parts. These drops are one example of an item that can be sold for
platinum or ducats and it's these items that we are after.
#### Purpose
The website scrapes the [official warframe drop rates](https://n8k6e2y6.ssl.hwcdn.net/repos/hnfvc0o3jnfvc873njb03enrf56.html)
and the popular trading site [warframe.market](https://warframe.market) to track what items a 
relic drops and, based on the chance and worth of each drop, how much a relic is worth. It can 
be easily searched, filtered, and sorted based on user preferences.
